What i want to do:
1. Register Player to ArrayList<Player>
2. Register Team to ArrayList<Team>
3. Register League to ArrayList<League>
4. Compare player's overall(power) by position - important!!!!
5. Compare Team's average overall in same league

So i divide player to forward, midfielder, back, goalkeeper

But normal football simulator game like fm, usually give same type of 
stat. So reset to Player (one class). Like fm, all abilities are in Player class.

ALL ABILITIES LIST
1. Physical skills
pace 스피드 (속도 + 가속도), stamina 체력, strength, jumping, agility 민첩성
2. 


And I make **FootballManager class** to deal with player's, team's, league's interaction
-> factory pattern!
