What i want to do:
1. Register Player to ArrayList<Player>
2. Register Team to ArrayList<Team>
3. Register League to ArrayList<League>
4. Compare player's overall(power) by position - important!!!!
5. Compare Team's average overall in same league

So i divide player to forward, midfielder, back, goalkeeper
